# Inspiration

The project is being taken inspiration from Joan Ramos Refusta project. This is an initial setup and a lot of changes are being worked upon to make it my own.

# Kritagya's OS

This is the most personal section of my portfolio, where I've created a simulated Windows OS with various desktop tools and references. Through this project, I aim to showcase not only my personal interests but also my skills in HTML and CSS. It's a reflection of both my personal life and my experience as a developer.

You can now explore it [here](https://Kritagya-os.vercel.app/).
